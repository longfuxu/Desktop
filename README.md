# Pomodoro Timer

## Introduction
The Pomodoro Timer is a simple and effective time management tool that can help you boost your productivity. It allows you to work in fixed time periods (called "Pomodoros"), followed by a short break. With this app, you can customize the duration of each Pomodoro and break period to suit your needs.

## Features

2. Click on the "Settings" button to set the desired Pomodoro and break times (in minutes).
3. Click on the "Start" button to begin the timer.

5. Once the Pomodoro time ends, a notification will appear, and the timer will automatically start the break time.
6. You can stop the timer at any time by clicking the "Stop" button.
